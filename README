Just some disorganized code for a potential 3d editor.
This is nothing more than a toy, don't expect to be able to build this
or do anything useful with it.
There are some paths hardcoded in the makefile,
and it uses my librw library so I can load some 3d files.

My plan was to recreate the old Alias user interface with dear imgui,
which seems to be working somewhat well.
I even got some basic marking menus.

I'm using dear imgui, imguizmo, lodepng and glad
